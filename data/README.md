//BINARY
"low level"

-NUMBERING SYSTEMS-
arabic numbers
decimal - base of 10
roman numerals

difference b/w roman & arabic:
linear, amount of symbols

the bigger your system, the more efficient it can be base10 vs. base8

base16 (hex) - 16 symbols
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
                    10 11 12 13 14 15
huge quantities w/ less symbols
2 values = 1 byte

C4 = 196
12akaCx16= 192
+4 = 196

base2 (binary)
representing electricity, voltage
assigning values by constructing a system
bit means a zero or a 1
8 values = 1 byte

using different numbering systems to make the same values
11111111 - byte
FF - byte
255 - byte

255 - a bite of space for that particular value (color), 8 ones
just enough for human sight
RGB - the primary color for light

no circles :(, digital world needs so many sides to mimic a circle

data storage///
disks storing binary data-
small small smmalllll etchings
computer punch cards -
burnable discs - burns 1s and 0s

volatile vs. non-volatile
need electricity to store info vs. don't need electricity to storage information (could write binary code down on paper to store files)

CPU - central processing unit////
does the math aka data processing (+GPU Graphical processing unit), v small chip
takes in the data, changes values

memory/ram////
where the data is stored, volatile storage

hard drive////
non-volatile storage
save something "taking those 1s and 0s and putting them in your hard drive"
tends to do something w/ magnetism
when your computer turns back, it sends it to the CPU and ram

lev manovich -
old media vs. new media
new media - stored numerically

ascii table
hex/decimal/oct/character
97/61/141/a
what values to assign to what values
wasn't initially bytes, highest value 127. used to be represented by 7 instead of 8.

interoperability - to get computers to work together, get computers to agree on the same stuff

bytes
kilabytes 1000 bytes
megabytes 10,000 bytes
gigabytes 100,0000 bytes

extensions categorizes/labels the file
brought hello.txt to photoshop as hello.raw
photoshop reinterprets the file since it's extension has been changed.
changes number into colors instead of into characters

INSTEAD OF ASCII WE GOT UNICODE
emooooji movie

how do we map numbers to the physical

machine code - raw data

header - media files, always the beginning of the data are metadata, the header of the file, body is the media information

42 4D - lets software know the file is a BMP file --> other file wooooo
alpha channel - transparency
BMP starts at the bottom right then goes right to left and bottom up

JPEG vs. RAW
lossless- compressed
compression - how do we combine information

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
README.md --> md = markdown

markdown (human code) vs. txt file
# header
## subheader
### more pounds
#### the smaller
###### the subheader
- first list
- second
- third

In Atom, the only difference w/ characters is the color

cmd+shift+p = search atom
-->markdown preview = output preview

defacto documentation and info of code

```html
<a href="http://saic.edu">school</a>```

my favorite function in Javascript is

```js
Math.random ()
```

README.md is like index.html - github loves md <3


XML - Xtensible (Extensible??) Markup Language
surround this information with the tags, categorical description which describes the type of data it surrounds
can put tag within other tags
