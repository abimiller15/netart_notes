## VoIP, IMAP, HTTP, BitTorrent
- different protocols aka rules
- most common type of clients is a browser
- terminal based client called curl
    - takes less code to be a server than a client
    - once upon a time, there were artists were making browser
- bittorrent - instead of client/server protocol
    - everyone's a server and client
    - coming directly from your computer, someone downloads from you not a server
    - the more popular a file is, the faster you can download it since more people will have it
    - base protocol, make sure there's a to/from IP address
