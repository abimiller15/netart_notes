The command line is a text interface for the computer's operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.
A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

* pwd outputs the name of the current working directory.
* ls lists all files and directories in the working directory.
* cd switches you into the directory you specify.
* mkdir creates a new directory in the working directory.
* touch creates a new file inside the working directory.

* -a - lists all contents, including hidden files and directories
* -l - lists all contents of a directory in long format
* -t - order files and directories by the time they were last modified.

- . = this folder


#git
- add . = add from last commit
- git status =
- git commit -m = commits, -m "add message here"
- git log = shows commit id
