# PROGRAMMING
[page link for lecture](http://netart.rocks/notes/helloworld)

"the magic...'that creates the world that we're living in'" -nick briz -douglas rushkoff

- Eloquent Javascript
- Ellen Ullman - computers are idiots, taking everything at face value. too true

Pre-computing
- things made to do specific things like trains to move things
- but what about something that did anything?? computers???
- everyday calculator was a computational table w/ pre-done equations
- computer to its core vs what they are today

#### ***programming programming***

history
- sol lewitt
    - taking instructions and figure out how to output them
- yoko ono
- binary operating as the instructions by rerouting circuitry
- assembly code, more readable versions of machine code
- rachel weil - NES assembly language

- c,py,php - using different languages yet getting the same results

### ***JAVASCRIPT***
- most used programming language
- terminal: node filename.js (remember to get in the folder before pulling up the file)

- google neural doodle
- artsqool by julian glander
- desktop and loading screen aesthetics
- API - applicatino procesing interface
- GUI - graphical user interface

### ***JAVASCRIPT***
How does a hard drive store differently from RAM?

- hard drive -
    - non-volatile
    - stored with magnets
- RAM
    - faster
    - electricity
    - volatile

Grace Hopper
- created a compiler, human readable language
    - compiler is the translator, interpreter

Brendan Eich
- created JS for Netscrape in 2 weeks
- originally called Mocha
- he made the rules and interpretive compiler

#### okay actuall js time

modulo division (remainder)
- good for time, moon cycles

variables
- to store data
- as long as they're not words JS already use you can do whatever
- naming a space in our ram and giving it value
- ***let*** and ***const*** instead of var
    - var has problems, let and const come from other language, both use in 2 different ways
- const: manages memory better
- let:
- can contain: strings, numbers, undefined

statement
- sentence
expression
- part of a sentence
- semicolon is only necessary if you have multiple statements on the same line

string
- letters as data, have to put them inbetween quotes
    - no quote? js thinks its a var
- can create a string with single quotes
- ticks are very flexible

object
- another data type
- sub variables aka properties
- s = {age: 100, name:"nick"};

.toUpperCase
- changing the string

console.clear
- clears the console wooo

### operator operator
```JS
+ - / % * =
```
- boolean operators
    - asking a question
    -  y > x (> is the boolean operator)
        - is y greater than x?

```JS
> < <= => === ==
```

- triple equal signs - are they exactly the same?
- ! opposite

logical operators woooo
- && - if this is true && this is true
- ||

***ARRRAYYYS***
- kind of like objects
- [] hard brackets + separate the values with commas
-

## **CodeAcademy JAVASCRIPT**
### Learn

"Just like a language has nouns, verbs, and prepositions, JavaScript has its own building blocks. Instead of calling them building blocks, however, developers call them data types"

String:
    -  Any grouping of words or numbers surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ".
Number:
    - Any number, including numbers with decimals, without quotes: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.
Boolean:
    - This is always one of two words. Either true or false, with no quotations.


We can ask JavaScript to print words to the console with this line of code:

console.log('Your message here.');

In human-speak, this is saying: "Hey console, please print/log this thing inside the parentheses. Bye, thanks!"

By writing this line, we've also solved the second thing we need: Something for JavaScript to say. We can put a String, Number, or Boolean (or any data type) inside the parentheses of a console.log statement.
